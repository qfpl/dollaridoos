The money library provides a typesafe wrapper around numeric types
that allows only those operations which are sensible in the context of
monetary sums.
For instance, adding two monetary values together makes sense, but
multiplying money by money doesn't make any sense.
Functions are also provided to multiply money by constants, among
other things.
